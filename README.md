<h1>Something about the project</h1>

<p>The project is a pet project, this is the backend of the project</p>

<h3>In the project i chose exactly this structure:</h3>

<h3>ðŸ“‚ Structure of the project</h3>

The project is built on the principle of separation of responsibilities:

<div>
  routes/ â€“ only routes (API).
</div>
<div>
  controllers/ â€“ accept a request, return an answer.
</div>

<div>
  services/ â€“ business-logic (checks, rules).
</div>

<div>
  models/ â€“ work with database (requests).
</div>

<div>
  middlewares/ â€“ common logic (authorization, errors).
</div>

<div>
  utils/ â€“ auxiliary functions
</div>

<div>
  config/ â€“ setting (env, clients).
</div>

<br>
âœ… advantage of the structure
<br>
<br>
Distinct layers â€” easy to read and support code
Scalability â€” just add new features
Reuse â€” services and models can be used in different places
